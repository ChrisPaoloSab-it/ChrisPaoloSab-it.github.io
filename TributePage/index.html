    <p>Dr. Nianshuang Wang, a distinguished scientist and a pioneer in the field of Structural Biology and Virology, has
        made significant contributions that have left an indelible mark on the scientific community.</p>
    <div class="main">
        <div class="education">
            <h2>Early Life and Education</h2>
            <p>Dr. Wang embarked on his scientific journey at Tsinghua University, where he earned his PhD degree in
                2014.</p>
            <p>Growing up as a farmer's son in a rural part of East China's Shandong Province, Wang discovered that he
                might have some special talent in biology.</p>
            <p>After finishing his undergraduate study in biology at Ocean University of China, Wang was admitted to the
                PhD program at China's renowned Tsinghua University in 2009, on recommendation without exams because of
                his academic prowess.</p>
            <p>Together with his adviser Wang Xinquan, associate dean at the School of Life Science at Tsinghua, they
                studied the MERS-CoV which emerged in 2012.</p>

            <p>Dr. Wang currently serves as a Research Fellow at the University of Texas and a scintist at Regeneron
                Pharmaceuticals. His work has been cited over 18,446 times since 2019, reflecting the impact and reach
                of his research. <br>
                When he first found a way to stabilize the shape-shifting spike protein of a coronavirus in 2016, Wang
                Nianshuang, then a postdoctoral researcher, and his collaborators had a hard time finding a journal
                willing to publish the results.
                <br> "The paper was rejected by five top scientific journals, and when it was
                finally published, one year had already passed," Wang, 34, told China Daily recently from his home in
                New Haven, Connecticut. <br>
                However, that rejected research became a key component in engineering effective COVID-19 vaccines
                produced by US biotech firm Moderna and US pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and its German development
                partner BioNTech. The technology is also being used by Johnson & Johnson, Novavax, CureVac and Translare
                Bio.

            <h2>Groundbreaking Research</h2>
            <p>During his PhD, he determined the structural mechanism of MERS-CoV receptor recognition. In partnership
                with Linqi Zhang's lab in 2014, they isolated the first monoclonal neutralizing antibody against
                MERS-CoV.</p>
            <p>In 2016, he developed a universal method to lock the shapeshifting S protein in the "prefusion" state by
                introducing two prolines into the protein. This technology, known as S-2P, was successfully applied in
                at least five major COVID-19 vaccines.</p>

        <div class="publications">
            <p>Dr. Wang's research has been in numerous high-impact journals. Some of his most cited works include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Cryo-EM structure of the 2019-nCoV spike in the prefusion conformation</li>
