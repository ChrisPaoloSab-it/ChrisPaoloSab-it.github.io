                    This document describes how IP access control lists (ACLs) can filter network traffic. It also
                    contains brief descriptions of the IP ACL types, feature availability, and an example of use in a

        <h2>ACL Concepts</h2>
        <section class="main-section" id="Masks">
            <header>Masks</header>
            <article>
                <p>Masks are used with IP addresses in IP ACLs to specify what must be permitted and denied. Masks in
                    order to configure IP addresses on interfaces start with 255 and have the large values in the left
                    side, for example, IP address 10.165.202.129 with a 255.255.255.224 mask. Masks for IP ACLs are the
                    reverse, for example, masks 0.0.0.255. This is sometimes called an inverse mask or a wildcard mask.
                    When the value of the mask is broken down into binary (0s and 1s), the results determine which
                    address bits to consider when traffic is processed. A 0 indicates that the address bits must be
                    considered (exact match); a 1 in the mask is a do not care. This table further explains the concept.
                </p>
                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Masks Example</th>
                        <th></th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>network address (traffic that is to be processed)</td>
                        <td>10.1.1.0</td>
                    </tr>

                        <td>network address (binary)</td>

                </table>
                <p>Based on the binary mask, you can see that the first three sets (octets) must match the given binary
                    network address exactly (00001010.00000001.00000001). The last set of numbers are do not cares
                    (.11111111). Therefore, all traffic that begins with 10.1.1. matches since the last octet is do not
                    care. Therefore, with this mask, network addresses 10.1.1.1 through 10.1.1.255 (10.1.1.x) are
                    processed.</p>
                <p>Subtract the normal mask from 255.255.255.255 in order to determine the ACL inverse mask. In this
                    example, the inverse mask is determined for network address 172.16.1.0 with a normal mask of
                    255.255.255.0.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>255.255.255.255 - 255.255.255.0 (normal mask) = 0.0.0.255 (inverse mask)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Notice the ACL equivalents.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The source/wildcard of 0.0.0.0/255.255.255.255 means <strong>any</strong></li>
                    <li>The source/wildcard of 10.1.1.2/0.0.0.0 is the same as host 10.1.1.2</li>

                <p>Traffic that comes into the router is compared to ACL entries based on the order that the entries
                    occur in the router. New statements are added to the end of the list. The router continues to look
                    until it has a match. If no matches are found when the router reaches the end of the list, the
                    traffic is denied. For this reason, you must have the frequently hit entries at the top of the list.
                    There is an implied deny for traffic that is not permitted. A single-entry ACL with only one deny
                    entry can deny all traffic. You must have at least one permit statement in an ACL or all traffic is
                    blocked. These two ACLs (101 and 102) have the same effect.</p>

                </p>
                <p>The router can display descriptive text on some of the well-known ports. Use
                    a<strong>?</strong>for help.</p>

                <header>Apply ACLs</header>
                <p>You can define ACLs and still not apply them. But, the ACLs have no effect until they are
                    applied to the interface of the router. It is a good practice to apply the ACL on the
                    interface closest to the source of the traffic. As shown in this example, when you try to
                    block traffic from source to destination, you can apply an inbound ACL to E0 on router A
                    instead of an outbound list to E1 on router C. An access-list has adeny ip any implicitly at
                    the end of any access-list. If traffic is related to a DHCP request and if it is not
                    explicitly permitted, the traffic is dropped because when you look at DHCP request in IP,
                    the source address is s=0.0.0.0 (Ethernet1/0), d=255.255.255.255, len 604, rcvd 2 UDP
                    src=68, dst=67. Notice that the source IP address is 0.0.0.0 and destination address is
                    255.255.255.255. Source port is 68 and destination 67. Therefore, you must permit this kind
                    of traffic in your access-list or else the traffic is dropped due to implicit deny at the
                    end of the statement.</p>
                <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> For UDP traffic to pass through, UDP traffic must also be
                    permitted explicitly by the ACL.</p>

                <header id="Standard">Standard ACLs</header>
                <p>Standard ACLs are the oldest type of ACL. They date back to as early as Cisco IOS Software Release
                    8.3. Standard ACLs control traffic by the comparison of the source address of the IP packets to the
                    addresses configured in the ACL.</p>
                <p>This is the command syntax format of a standard ACL.</p>
                <code>access-list &lt;access-list-number&gt; {permit|deny} {host|source source-wildcard|any}</code>
                <p>In all software releases, the access-list-number can be anything from 1 to 99. In Cisco IOS Software
                    Release 12.0.1, standard ACLs begin to use additional numbers (1300 to 1999). These additional
                    numbers are referred to as expanded IP ACLs. Cisco IOS Software Release 11.2 added the ability to
                    use list name in standard ACLs.</p>
                <p>A source/source-wildcard setting of 0.0.0.0/255.255.255.255 can be specified as any . The wildcard
                    can be omitted if it is all zeros. Therefore, host 10.1.1.2 0.0.0.0 is the same as host 10.1.1.2.
                </p>
                <p>After the ACL is defined, it must be applied to the interface (inbound or outbound). In early
                    software releases, out was the default when a keyword out or in was not specified. The direction
                    must be specified in later software releases.</p>

                <header>Extended ACLs</header>
                <p>Extended ACLs were introduced in Cisco IOS Software Release 8.3. Extended ACLs control traffic by the
                    comparison of the source and destination addresses of the IP packets to the addresses configured in
                    the ACL.</p>

                <p>In all software releases, the access-list-number can be 100 to 199. In Cisco IOS Software Release
                    12.0.1, extended ACLs begin to use additional numbers (2000 to 2699). These additional numbers are
                    referred to as expanded IP ACLs. Cisco IOS Software Release 11.2 added the ability to use list name
                    in extended ACLs.</p>
